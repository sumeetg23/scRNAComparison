# scRNAComparison
Comparison of scRNA-Seq preps

Objective: To compare different single cell plate based library prep kits. Testing was done of the same cell type as the li et al. The data from different kits was compared with the published data to get a sense of the quality and accuracy of the datasets from different commerically available sc prep kits.

Datasets from 4 commercial library prep kits (KIT1, KIT2, KIT3 and KIT4 - 48 cells each) and already PUBLISHED dataset (NCBI GEO accession number GSE117233 - 288 cells)
